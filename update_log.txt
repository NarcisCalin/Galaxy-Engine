CPU Multitreading optimizaion Summary:
---------------------------
- fully parallelized particle updates, force calculations, quadtree builds, and rendering using OpenMP.
- buildQuadtree():
    - Parallelized with #pragma omp parallel for.
    - Protected quadtree->insert() with #pragma omp critical to avoid race conditions.
- applyForces():
    - Parallelized with #pragma omp parallel for.
    - Each particle only interacts with nearby particles using a quadtree spatial query (local 100x100 area).
- updateParticles():
    - Parallelized with #pragma omp parallel for.
    - Forces and velocity updates scaled by frame time (GetFrameTime()) for frame-rate independent simulation.
- drawParticles():
    - Parallelized with #pragma omp parallel for.
    - Each particle drawn independently.
- handleInput():
    - Parallelized clearing of particle selection flags.
- InitParticles():
    - Pre-sized particle vector, then initialized particles in parallel.
- Increased default particle count (InitParticles(100000)) to stress CPU.

 heres the result:
- Supports 10000+ particles at higher FPS (like from 8 to 12fps) on modern CPUs, I havent tested if this is more effective on low end CPUs yet.
- I noticed a little less CPU utilization.
- overall I think this isnt a too big of a improvement, but I got a little FPS boost (I had 6fps @ 20K particles, now its like 10-12fps)

  April 13, 2025, optimizations:

 Unified selection logic into a handleSelection() lambda (DRY principle).
 Shortened vector math using Vector2Subtract and Vector2LengthSqr.
 Default initialized everything in the constructor initializer list.
 Reused conditions like dragStarted and dragging.
 Kept all variable names the same to preserve meaning.

 I wrote negative lines of code, like -45 or something,
 I don't know if that's good or bad, but if it's short, simple, works and readable, then I'm not complaining.
